    <h2 id="loveParks">Parks are our classrooms, playgrounds, and places of escape and peace. They let us experience solitude, quiet, natural sights and sounds undisturbed by civilization, and beauty as simple as skies so dark you can see by starlight. The National Park System is ever-changing. There are new lands, water,  plants, and wildlife to protect, and new history to commemorate as time passes. You can help us ensure that our parks are treasured forever.

        Our preservation and conservation projects work to acquire the missing pieces of our national parks, the privately owned land located within and adjacent to our national parks’ boundaries. See the lands and landmarks we’ve added to our National Park System near you and across the nation in the map below.
        
        By making a donation to the National Park Trust, you ensure that our parks and public lands are treasured forever.</h2>

        <p>Preservation is about deciding what's important, figuring out how to protect it, and passing along an appreciation for what was saved to the next generation. The National Park Service employs archeologists, architects, curators, historians, and other professionals to help ensure the protection and preservation of the lands and objects entrusted to our care. Beyond the parks, national preservation partnership programs document historic places, develop standards and guidelines, and provide financial and technical assistance to preserve our shared heritage.</p>

        <h3>Love Your Park</h3>
        <p> The first step to encourage stewardship of our parks is to teach kids why our parks are important. Encourage kids to spend time outside in a natural setting. Go for hikes, go swimming, camp, and play games in local, state, and national parks. Encourage kids to ask questions and make observations about the natural world around us.</p>
        <h3>Litter Competition</h3>
        <p>Turn a day picking up litter into a fun event for families, schools, or other groups. Meet at a park, schoolyard, or other outdoor space, and divide participants into teams. Give each team large trash bags marked in a distinctive way, such as by color. Teams collect trash, and the team that fills the most bags wins. Be sure to get permission for the clean-up from the appropriate place. You can ask for donations to use as prizes, and award prizes for the most trash collected, the most unusual trash item found, and even the team showing the most “flair” while collecting litter.</p>
        <h3>Adopt a Park</h3>
        <p>Contact park rangers or other park supervisors to adopt a nearby park. Once you have permission, bring kids to your adopted park on a regular schedule, such as once a month, to participate in keeping the park clean and well-maintained. Following the park supervisor’s direction, kids can pick up litter, remove invasive species, mulch, and paint.</p>
        <h3>Create an Ad Campaign</h3>
        <p>Kids can encourage others to care about and protect a national, state, or local park by convincing them to visit the park. Have kids brainstorm ways they can promote their favorite park in their school or community. Some ideas to get you started include a poster campaign, intercom or radio announcements, a newspaper ad, a podcast about the park, speaking to community groups or other classes, or holding a special event in the park with a supervisor’s permission.</p>
        <h3>Host a Photo Contest</h3>
        <p>Kids can encourage others to see the beauty in a local, state, or national park by holding a park photo contest. The contest can be for photos from one park or from any park within a certain distance. Kids should find a place to display the photos, advertise the contest, and seek donations for prizes. Prizes can be given in several categories, such as by age, best close-up image, best landscape image, or best image of people in a park.</p>
        <h3>Hold a FUNdraiser</h3>
        <p>Kids can hold a FUNdraiser to raise money for a park conservation organization, such as the National Park Foundation . Have kids research organizations before committing to donating money. Some ideas for FUNdraisers include a park-themed bingo night, a raffle, a dance, a craft fair, a car wash, or a board game tournament.</p>
        <h3>Leave No Trace</h3>
        <p>Leave No Trace is a set of ethics for interacting with the outdoors in a thoughtful, sustainable manner. Some of the basics include planning ahead to minimize waste, taking care not to disturb plants and animals, and hiking and camping in appropriate areas. Encourage kids to practice Leave No Trace to minimize their impact on natural spaces. For more about the Leave No Trace movement, go to https://lnt.org.</p>
