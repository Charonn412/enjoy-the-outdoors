    <p id="loveParks">Parks are our classrooms, playgrounds, and places of escape and peace. They let us experience solitude, quiet, natural sights and sounds undisturbed by civilization, and beauty as simple as skies so dark you can see by starlight. The National Park System is ever-changing. There are new lands, water,  plants, and wildlife to protect, and new history to commemorate as time passes. You can help us ensure that our parks are treasured forever.

        Our preservation and conservation projects work to acquire the missing pieces of our national parks, the privately owned land located within and adjacent to our national parks’ boundaries. See the lands and landmarks we’ve added to our National Park System near you and across the nation in the map below.

        <p>Preservation is about deciding what's important, figuring out how to protect it, and passing along an appreciation for what was saved to the next generation. The National Park Service employs archeologists, architects, curators, historians, and other professionals to help ensure the protection and preservation of the lands and objects entrusted to our care. Beyond the parks, national preservation partnership programs document historic places, develop standards and guidelines, and provide financial and technical assistance to preserve our shared heritage.</p>
